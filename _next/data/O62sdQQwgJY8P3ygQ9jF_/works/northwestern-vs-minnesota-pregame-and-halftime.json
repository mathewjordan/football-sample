Conducted by Dale Lonis, pregame performances include \"Go U Northwestern\" and \"Wildcat Fantasy.\" The halftime performance theme was a salute to heroes and included the \"1984 Olympic Fanfare\" and the \"Theme to Shaft.\" The performances from Minnesota were recorded over a televised Big 10 Section special about marching bands and that content is interspersed in between the performances. Also included is a performance of \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" by the Northwestern University Marching Band during the halftime performance of a football game against the Indiana Hoosiers. Marching band content is followed by about 20 minutes of daytime television and then recordings from a conducting class.","canonical":"https://mathewjordan.github.io/football-sample/works/northwestern-vs-minnesota-pregame-and-halftime","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://dcapi.rdc-staging.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/e8bd2ac7-5188-45b2-80e8-27f7d072cdd0/thumbnail","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":300,"alt":"Northwestern vs. Minnesota: Pregame and Halftime"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsxs(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n          size: \"8\",\n          mb: \"5\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n          size: \"4\",\n          color: \"gray\"\n        })]\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\nfunction _missingMdxReference(id, component) {\n  throw new Error(\"Expected \" + (component ? \"component\" : \"object\") + \" `\" + id + \"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\");\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true}
