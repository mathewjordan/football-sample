Most of the prints are portraits of Northwestern University faculty, administrators, and students. Also included are a number of photographs of class and student groups, University buildings, and portraits of Northwestern University Preparatory School students. Most of the prints are mounted on cardboard stock and range in size from approximately 4\" x 6\" to 4-1/2\" x 7\". Prints of buildings and student groups are sorted into alphabetically-arranged topics. Portraits of Northwestern faculty and administrators are arranged alphabetically by the subjects’ surnames. Portraits of students are arranged by their class year (year of graduation; for example, Class of 1878, Class of 1879, etc.) When multiple portraits exist for a given year they are alphabetized within folders by students’ surnames. Unidentified or partially identified portraits are at the end of the series. The series includes two copies of Hesler’s book, Photographic Views of Picturesque Evanston (1887)."]}},{"label":{"none":["Series"]},"value":{"none":["Topically Arranged Photographs"]}},{"label":{"none":["Source"]},"value":{"none":["Class Photograph Albums"]}},{"label":{"none":["Subject"]},"value":{"none":["Illinois--Evanston","College athletes","Northwestern University (Evanston, Ill.)","Photographs"]}}],"requiredStatement":{"label":{"none":["Attribution"]},"value":{"none":["Courtesy of Northwestern University Libraries","The images on this web site are from material in the collections of the University Archives of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.
