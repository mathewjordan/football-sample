at the Rose Bowl, 1995 - Football","description":"Coverage of the January 1, 1996 Rose Bowl Game between the Northwestern Wildcats and the Southern California Trojans. A CBS Sunday Morning segment highlights Northwestern University's historic appearances in the 1948/1949 and 1995/1996 Rose Bowl games. The program features an overview of the season's games and interviews with former player Alex Sarkisian, Music School Dean Fred Hemke, coach Gary Barnett, and players Darnell Autry and Steve Schnur. Also included is the parade in Disneyland and network coverage of the 107th Tournament of Roses parade including performances by the Northwestern University Marching Band and the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band. Northwestern's band plays \"My Favorite Things\" and \"Go U Northwestern,\" and USC's band plays \"Everything's Coming Up Roses.\" Before the Rose Bowl, short interviews and features about the Northwestern Wildcats are shown, including one by Charleton Heston. The USC Trojan Marching Band performs the National Anthem and the Rose Bowl begins. Halftime performances by the Northwestern University Marching band include selections from Rossini's \"Barber of Seville,\" Camille Saint-Saëns' \"Samson and Delilah,\" and Puccini's \"Turandot.\" After being undefeated in the Big Ten, the Northwestern Wildcats ultimately lose the Rose Bowl to the USC Trojans by a score of 32-41.","canonical":"https://mathewjordan.github.io/football-sample/works/northwestern-at-the-rose-bowl-1995","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/e97fa341-5032-4ab1-a00e-237c41f2c8c5/thumbnail","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":300,"alt":"Northwestern at the Rose Bowl, 1995"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsxs(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n          size: \"8\",\n          mb: \"5\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n          size: \"4\",\n          color: \"gray\"\n        })]\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\nfunction _missingMdxReference(id, component) {\n  throw new Error(\"Expected \" + (component ? \"component\" : \"object\") + \" `\" + id + \"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\");\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"northwestern-at-the-rose-bowl-1995"},"buildId":"LbeCznsa7Dbao1ueF18J2","assetPrefix":"/football-sample","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
