First, the Northwestern University Marching Band performs at the Northwestern Wildcats' game against the Minnesota Gophers in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The halftime performance theme was a salute to heroes and included the \"1984 Olympic Fanfare\" and the \"Theme to Shaft.\" The University of Minnesota Marching Band halftime performance includes \"Theme from Shaft\" and \"Latina.\" After the Minnesota Homecoming Court is announced, \"Hail Minnesota\" is performed. Postgame performances by both bands include \"Go U Northwestern,\" \"Minnesota Rouser,\" \"California Dreaming,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Theme from Shaft,\" and \"Alma Mater.\" The second performance is from the Northwestern Wildcats' Homecoming game against the Purdue Boilermakers at Dyche Stadium in Evanston, Illinois. The NUMB Alums from 1930-1985 begin the pregame performances with \"Go U Northwestern.\" The Northwestern University Marching Band, conducted by Dale Lonis, performs the National Anthem, \"Hail Purdue\" \"Wildcat Fantasy,\" and \"Go U Northwestern.\" Composer Sheldon Harnick served as Grand Marshal for the homecoming game. Halftime performances include Harnick's \"I Can't Stand Dragons,\" which was arranged by John P. Paynter. \"On Broadway\" and \"National Emblem\" were also performed. The NUMB alums join the marching band for \"Strike Up the Band.\" John P. Paynter then conducts Alma Mater. Postgame performances by the NU Marching Band include \"Go U Northwestern,\" \"When the Saints Go Marching In,\" \"Fame,\" \"Bill Bailey Won't You Please Come Home,\" and \"Alma Mater.\"","canonical":"https://mathewjordan.github.io/football-sample/works/northwestern-vs-minnesota-and-northwestern-vs-purdue-2","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://dcapi.rdc-staging.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/842df04b-4329-4647-ab6d-1d71b5b80dd4/thumbnail","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":300,"alt":"Northwestern vs. Minnesota and Northwestern vs. Purdue"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsxs(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n          size: \"8\",\n          mb: \"5\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n          size: \"4\",\n          color: \"gray\"\n        })]\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\nfunction _missingMdxReference(id, component) {\n  throw new Error(\"Expected \" + (component ? \"component\" : \"object\") + \" `\" + id + \"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\");\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"northwestern-vs-minnesota-and-northwestern-vs-purdue-2"},"buildId":"O62sdQQwgJY8P3ygQ9jF_","assetPrefix":"/football-sample","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
